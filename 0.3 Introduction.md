# Introduction: An Unusual Experiment
We shall now try to describe the complex process of thinking which takes place in a grandmaster's mind during play. To explain his thought processes as clearly as possible let us try a little experiment that was suggested to me by the method of
studying mechanics in high school. First of all one studies Statics - the effect of forces on a body at rest - and then Dynamics, in which the same phenomena are studied in motion. So, too, we shall first consider how to think about moves from the static point of view, and then later in the book from the dynamic.

Let us then imagine the room where a top-class tournament is being played. Let us go on to the stage and ask one of the players, for example Polugaevsky, to give up his
seat to us. Let us now ask Smyslov to tell us straight away without any further consideration the course of his thought as he studies a position in which he, White, is to move.

I can be certain that his first reaction would be count how many pawns there are. As a rule a grandmaster can take in at a glance, without counting, how many pieces there
are. However, he may at times also count the pieces. We now assume that Polugaevsky has not sacrificed anything and so matrial is level.

The next stage in Smyslov's thinking will be to clarify the following points:

First, from which opening has this position arisen. If not many moves have been made, he will be able to ascertain this from the pawn configuration and the positon of the pieces. If we are well into the middlegame then one has to work on the remnants of te pawn stcture, on the open files and diagonals and outpost for the knights.

Then there follows the question: have I ever had this position before, or has it ever occurred in games by other grandmasters? This is an i­mporant point in clarifing matters, as if one can call to mind similar positions from earlier games, then it is easier to reach an assessment of how things stand, and to hit upon the correct plan or analyse variations. Such a use of accumulated knowledge is an excellent way of saving thinking time as well as avoiding errors or the wrong plan.

This period of thought, which we call the clarifcation period, is very important. Here the main role is played by the knowledge, experience and erudition of the grandmas­ter. Naturally the memory plays its part in helping to bring to mind the
moves played in games of long ago. One can find remarkable examples of this technique in the games of Alekhine and Botvinnik who were thereby helped to produce great works of art.

Armed with these preliminary soundings, the grandmaster then attempt to assess the position. He not only has to solve the basic problem of who stands better; he also has to discern the nature of the position down to its smallest details. He will
note the presence and comparative value of various open lines, all the while bearing in mind the concrete tasks that lie before him: occupy this open file or diagonal, close that one, on this file neutralise the action of the enemy rooks. He will aso work out which important outposts he should occupy with his knights, from which outposts he should drive out the enemy cavalry. It will become clear to him which of his pawns and those of the opponent are weak, where there are strong passed pawns. In a more subconscious than conscious way he will establish where there is co-operation and harmony between his pieces, and like wise for the opponent. He will say to himself mentally: this is what I have to put right; here is where I must regroup.

It will not cause Smyslov much trouble to establish which side controls the center, and what is the influence on the centre of this or that piece. Then he will assess the value of each side's pawn chains, and find out where pawn advances are possible. Afer all this he will understand more clearly who has the better position, who has the initiative, who must attack, who will be forced to defend. He will decide where White must attack if Black merely defends, or instead tries to counter-attack on
the flank. Or will Black try for a blow in the centre -a grandmaster knows full well that the best answer to a flank attack is a counter-blow in the centre.

Finaly, if the position is even, Smyslov will decide that he must manoeuve quietly so as to provoke weanesses in the enemy camp.

This then is the way that a grand­master in the tournament room goes about assessing a position. We can­ not claim that he will deal with the element of the position in this precise order. Much of what we have categorised he will probably entrust
to his intuition, but in one way or another the various problems will be
considered and solved.

How much time does this process take? Naturally this depends on the ability of the gradmaster and on the special features of each particular position. There is also the element of temperament. It is well known that with some players sober analysis
plays the main part, while with others, intuition developed by anaytical practice predominates. Assessing a position is very important and a lot of time is devoted to it.

Only when he has gone through
this preparatory work will Smyslov start to draw up a plan. The direction
of a player's thoughts is governed
principally by the features of a given
position, but no small part belongs
to the character of the player. Petrosian would most likely give first
thought to how to defend his weaknesses, whereas Tal would probably
start to look for the chance to prepare a sacrifice.


So in one way or another our
grandmaster will decide the general
plan of campaign, where to direct
his pieces, what to attck, and in
case of necessity how to defend.
Along with this general plan, he will
have a more concrete plan, which
decides what his next few moves
will be: occupy this square, exchange
that pawn, etc. He will also see what
his opponent's plan is, and how he
can cross it.


Up to this stage a grandmaster's
thoughts have been based on general
ideas and strategic principles. Now,
at long last, he will start looking for
the best move. He will establihh what
moves are possible, and how they fit
in with his plan. Then he will begin
analysing many variation. For each
of te moves he will examnie, he
will foresee the opponent's reply,
then his best answer and so on. Only after finishing this immense task,
now purely anaytical, will Smyslov
move a piece and stop his clock.
Thinkng over, move made!

Our experiment has enabled us
to examine the sequence of a grandmaster's thoughts when he is choosing the best move in a given position. We have also leaned from it that a real chess player must have the fol­lowing qualites:

1. He must be well up in modern opening theory.
2. He must kown and keep in his memory the principles behind typical middlegame positions learned
both from his own games, and from
those of other players. The more a
player knows and remembers, the
easier it is for him to find a 'precedent', i.e. a position that has occured before and which is similar to
his own present position. Naturally,
it is not a question of mechanical
memorising, but of knowing methods and possibly separate moves and
combinations employed at some time
or other and appropriately asessed
in subsequent notes and analysis.
We shall call these first two qualities
with good reason 'chess erudition'.
3. A grandmater must be able to
assess a position accurately and cor­rectly.
4. No less important is the ability
to hit upon the right plan, which must
meet the demands of the given position.
5. A grandmaster must be able to
caculate accurately and quickly all the signifcant vaiations that might
arise in the subsequent course of
play.

These then are the most important
qualities which players should develop within themselve, mainly by
practice, analysis and personal ef­fort. We shall now examine all these
qualities and show how they can be acquired by dint of hard work. To facilitate their teatment we shall deal
with them in a different order.
