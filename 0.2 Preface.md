# Preface
An immense number of books have been written on chess. Some chess writers annotate and bring up to date works on opning variations, but, strange as it may seem, no one has had the idea of decribing the methods by which the leading players of our time have reached the peak of their playing strength. Yet a study of these methods would greatly faciliate the process of mastering the intricacies of the game.

In this book the author decribes how Botvinnik, Tal, Smyslov, Petrosian, Keres, Bronstein and many other leading grandmasters studied chess theory, and trained themselves to understand the mysteries of chess strategy and tactics. They themselves have revealed some of their methods in articles and game annotations, while I have become acquainted with others from personal conversations with my fellow grandmasters.

The reader will also find an account of my own personal experi­ence -my achevements in the field of chess are the result of immense hard work in studying theory, and I
flatter myself that this experience will prove to be of interest to the reader.

Chess is a complex game, yet millions of enthusiasts are faci­nated by it. Some of them reach the playing strength of a first or second category player, while others are satisfied to be known all their life as 'a beginner'. Yet surely even a weak player would like to win a chess title and be known as mater, or even grandmaster. If someone could only show them how to reah this goal, then many of these enthusiasts would be prepaed to set off along the long and irksome road of tournament play with all it excitng and nerve-racking experiences.

How then does one become a grandmaster? Is it the case that a strong player's abilities are purely natural, and that hard work cannot change anything? Naturally there must be some inherent ability, but as in other spheres of human endeavour the main factor is immense, u­nstinting effort to master the skills of chess stategy and tactics.

That great chess thinker Emanuel Lasker asserted that in the space of 100 hours he could produce a first category player from a young man of average ability. Could one go f­urther than that? Lasker never had occasion to prove te validity of his claim; the question naturally arises could one by dint of careful study and hard work go as far as becoming a master or in the end a grandmaster?  

My own experience tells me that such study and hard work do lead to immense improvements in one's practical results. I would remind the reader that up to 1938 I had never managed to reach master standard, but my study of te game in te period 1936-37 led suddenly to a 'great leap forward'. I gained the master title in 1938 and only one year later that of grandmaster. It follows that one can become a grand­master by one's own endeavours: one merely has to work hard at it. How exactly to go about it is contained in this book.

A few points are worth noting:

1) My desire to make the book as clear and helpful as possible has led me to employ new names for some strategic laws and concepts. This was not done in an attempt to
try for a unnecessarily scientifc approach, but merely to help the memorisation of important points. 

2) The book makes use to a large extent of the games and advice of those Soviet grandmaters who b­elong to what is now called the older generation. The reason for this is that all my chess career I have rubbed shoulders with Botvinnik, Keres and Smyslov. The younger grandmasters, on the other hand, are busy with their current tournament battles and write less about their thought processes at the board, normally restricting themselves to giving concrete variations.

3) The book contains games by the author -again easily understandable as, in aiming to describe the secret of the chess mind, I have naturally had to dig down deep into
my own brain.

So, dear reader, forward into battle, to storm the heights of grand­mater chess!
